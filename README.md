# VoiceActivatedGame
This is a game that I made with the help of my CS-159 professor, Dr. Isaac Wang. We made it as a demonstration of the capabilities of Natural Language Processing in the video game industry. Feel free to download and try it out! All of the necessary files to run the game are included in this repository. Uses google dialogueflow NLP API.
